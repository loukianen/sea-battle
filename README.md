The project used: React + Redux, Bootstrap, Eslint as linter, Jest for testing, Webpack to build the project. The internationalization is implemented using the i18next library. Asynchronous actions in Redux are done using the Thunk library. Within the React library, both functional and class components are used. The same goes for lifecycle methods and hooks.
